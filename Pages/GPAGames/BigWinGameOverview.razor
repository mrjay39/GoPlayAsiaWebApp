            <p><span class="text-gray"><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-secondary me-3"></i> Player bets for desired combination/s in correct order.

            <p><span class="text-gray"><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-secondary me-3"></i> A confirmation button shall appear for the player to confirm selected bet option and amount by clicking "Yes," otherwise "No".</span></p><br>
            <p><span class="text-gray"><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-secondary me-3"></i> The system timer starts until the allotted period for betting ends. System automatically disables all access for betting and changes the status to "CLOSED".</span></p>
            <p><span class="text-gray"><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-secondary me-3"></i> At the conclusion of betting, the Dealer shall start with the dealing procedure in the following sequence:</span></p>
            <p class="ms-3 text-gray">⦁	&nbsp;&nbsp; The Dealer shall pick up the ball inside each canister.</p>
            <p class="ms-3 text-gray">⦁	&nbsp;&nbsp; After retrieval, the Dealer shall immediately spin the ball in any way on top of each transparent funnel, from first canister to fourth canister, in that order.</p>
            <p class="ms-3 text-gray">⦁	&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait until the balls settle on every canister, the Dealer then shall declare/encode the winning outcome, in the same order as spun, in the Dealer's Tablet for the Game Validator's confirmation.</p>
            <p class="ms-3 text-gray">⦁	&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Dealer determines the game result, validation of the result shall be remotely performed by the proponent on a separate module ("Validator"). Only after confirmation of the result that the winning bets shall be processed.</p>
            <p class="ms-3 text-gray">⦁	&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Dealer determines the game result, another validation shall be performed by the proponent on a separate module ("Validator"). Only after confirmation of the result that the winning bets shall be processed.</p> <br>
            <p><span class="text-gray"><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-secondary me-3"></i> The Dealer shall perform this dealing cycle continuously during his stint until he is relieved by another Dealer, the last deal has been announced, or the equipment needs to undergo maintenance.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text-gray"><i class="fa-solid fa-check text-secondary me-3"></i> The Dealer shall replace the balls every shift in different colors. But in case of a damaged ball, such as dents or breakage, within the shift, the same color of ball shall be used.</span></p>

            <p><span class="text-gray"><i class="fa-solid fa-exclamation text-warning me-3"></i> Should any of the ping-pong/rubber balls become damaged, such as deformed, cracked, or dented, the Dealer shall immediately inform the PS for replacement of the said ball. The game result shall be considered valid if the damage, deformity, crack, or dent is detected only during play or as soon as the ball has settled on the wheel, provided the defective ball remains intact. The damaged ball/s must be replaced immediately after the game.</span></p><br>
            <p><span class="text-gray"><i class="fa-solid fa-exclamation text-warning me-3"></i> Should any of the ball/s breaks, splits, or fragments into two or more pieces during play, the defective ball is automatically deemed invalid and must be replaced   immediately.
