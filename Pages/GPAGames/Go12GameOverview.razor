            <p class="mb-0"><b>METHOD OF PLAY</b></p>
            <p class="text-gray">GO12 is a drop ball game played using a ping-pong/rubber ball spun in any way on top of a transparent funnel by the Dealer. The ball falls through the funnel to settle onto a numbered wheel from 01 to 12. The wheel is divided by a separator into twelve (12) segments alternately colored black and red.; hence, each number has a corresponding color.</p> <br>
            <p class="text-gray">The object of the game is to choose the correct number and/ or color where the ball will settle after dropping from a funnel.</p>
